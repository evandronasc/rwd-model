#Front End - Base Sass + Jade

This is a simple website framework based on [Sass](http://http://sass-lang.com/), [Compass](http://http://compass-style.org/), [Zen-Grids](http://http://zengrids.com/), [Breakpoints](http://https://github.com/canarymason/breakpoint) and [Jade](http://https://github.com/visionmedia/jade#readme).

Always a W.I.P!
##Sass:
Sass is an extension of CSS3, adding nested rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more. Itâ€™s translated to well-formatted, standard CSS using the command line tool or a web-framework plugin.

##Compass:
Compass is an open-source CSS authoring framework which uses the Sass stylesheet language to make writing stylesheets powerful and easy.

##Zen-Grids:
A responsive grid system built with the power of Sass.

##Breakpoints:
Breakpoint makes writing media queries in Sass super simple. Create a variable using a simplified syntax based on most commonly used media queries, then call it using the `breakpoint` mixin. Breakpoint handles all of the heavy lifting, from writing the media query itself, to handling cross-browser compatibility issues, so you can focus on what's important: making sure your website looks its best.

##Jade:
Jade is a high performance template engine heavily influenced by Haml and implemented with JavaScript for node. It's an **optional tool** but its use is **heavily recommanded**.

##Dummy:
Dummy is a toolkit designed to make the development, testing and presentation of web prototypes less time consuming and more realistic. It does so by helping you populate your work with content and by randomizing key aspects of it's layout, in a way, simulating connectivity to a live database, and making it possible to visualize, test and present something much closer to the outcome of a finished project.
